# Coding Practices

## Programming Languages
I prefer to code in Python language, due to the extensive documentation and high level programming. For analytics I prefer to code in the R language using R studio, as this
offers al lot of visualization options, backened by an extensive amount of documentation. 

## Software
To save the all my code and progress in the cloud, I prefer to use GitHub. This makes it easier to make my work accessible from other computers for other collaborators and is
easy to use. As a means to run my code in small batches and to explore unseen data, I tend to use jupyter notebook. This allows me to run code in seperate cells, improving the error handling in the code. And to put the code in production and make it runable as a whole, I write my code in VSCode. This is a handy text editor that allows the installation of packages (such as an extension with Github) and easy error handling. 

## Libraries
For Machine Learning purposes, I tend to use the SKlean library. It offers extensive documentation and a high number of ML algorithms and metrics that are easy to implement and highly effective. For quick visualization I tend to use matplotlib. This offers les options than R, but is usable within the python language and easier to implement. I als tend to use Numpy for math operations within the code, as this runs more effectively than pure python. And for big datasets, I aim to use Tensorflow library. I have very little experience with the usage, but I will try to implement this, so I can run my code on the GPU.
