# CrowdednessPrediction

## Abstract
The aim of this research is to construct a model that predicts the crowdedness at selected spots within the city of Amsterdam, in the form of a time series. Historical data will be gathered from localized crowdedness measure points and will be combined with GVB data. The predictions with the given data will be made with both a multivariate regression model and a gradient boosted decision tree. The predicted crowdedness of both models will be visualized in separate time series over a given period of time. The two models will be compared in the evaluation based on the loss.
